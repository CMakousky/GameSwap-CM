## Problem:
As an avid gamer who enjoys physical media, I would like to be able to expand the number of video games that I can experience. I have limited funds, and I would like to be able to try out new games before I commit to purchasing them.

## Solution:
### “GameSwap: Power to the Players”
“GameSwap: Power to the Gamers”

GameSwap is a web-based software application that allows users to borrow video games from an extensive library of hand-selected games. GameSwap is designed for the temporary exchange of physical media. Users will sign up and log into GameSwap from a login modal.

Users can browse GameSwap’s database for a variety of interesting titles. GameSwap will keep track of these games in a MongoDB NoSQL database. On the home page, an array of games that are available to borrow will be displayed. A search bar feature will allow users to limit the number of displayed titles based on user input.

Users can select games from the home page that they would like to borrow. Users will be able to view their ongoing swaps on a dedicated “account” page. Details on the end/due dates for each ongoing swap will be available for viewing.
