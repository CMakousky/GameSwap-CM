## Problem:
As an avid gamer who enjoys physical media, I would like to be able to rent new game titles for a limited time period.

## Solution:
### “GameSwap: Power to the Players”
“GameSwap: Power to the Players”

GameSwap is a software that allows users to rent physical video games from GameSwap’s extensive library of games. GameSwap is designed for the temporary exchange of physical media. Users will sign up and log into GameSwap from a login modal.

Users can browse GameSwap’s database for a variety of interesting titles. GameSwap will keep track of these games in a MongoDB NoSQL database.

On the home page, an array of games that are available for swap will be displayed. A list of games that are currently swapped and unavailable for trade will also be displayed on the home page. Return/due-dates for the unavailable games will be displayed next to the appropriate titles.

Users can select games from the home page that they would like to borrow. Users will be able to view their ongoing swaps on a dedicated “swap” page. Details on the end/due dates for each ongoing swap will be available for viewing.
